This is part of a group project I participated in for an advanced machine learning class I took for my graduate degree. I worked on it in Spring 2025. It uses data from the U.S. Geological Survey containing time series data of streams and rivers. The goal of this project was to compare various regression models' abilities to preduct future water height levels. Each group member tried a different regression method. I chose to try decision trees - XGBoost and Random Forest.
